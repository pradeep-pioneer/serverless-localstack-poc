# Localstack POC


A simple Proof of concept demonstrating the usage of localstack to build cloud applications for AWS.

This repo contains a couple of application examples:

* A [simple API](./01-api-lambda-dynamodb/) that stores data in DynamoDB
* A [more complex distributed system](./02-api-dynamodb-sqs-lambda-s3/) that relies on API Gateway, Lambdas, SQS, DynamoDB and S3.
